## What is a Knowledge Base? 

  

A Knowledge Base is a repository of information that your AI agents use to retrieve accurate and relevant responses to user queries. This repository can include documents, FAQs, manuals, and other structured data. The system utilizes retrieval augmented generation (RAG), which extracts information from a vector database.

## What is a RAG System? 

  #

The RAG system combines two powerful components that ensures your agents deliver highly accurate and contextually relevant responses: 

>**Retrieval:** Searches the Knowledge Base to find relevant information. 

> **Augmented Generation:** Uses the retrieved information to generate precise and contextually accurate responses using one of the LLMs available in Glowstudio.

# Crafting Your Agent's Knowledge Base

Building a robust knowledge base is crucial to ensure your agent has up to date information and gives responses that meets your clients needs. Follow these steps to create a well-structured and efficient knowledge base:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Preparing Data">
    Organize your data into easily accessible documents. This step is fundamental for efficient information retrieval.
#
    - **Label Your Documents:** Organzation is key, both for yourself and your client. This ensures easy navigation and .For example:
      - FAQs in a "Frequently Asked Questions" 
      - User manuals in a "Product Documentation"
      - Company policies in a "Corporate Guidelines"
#
    - **Label Clearly:** Use descriptive titles for your documents. For instance:
      - "Product-X-User-Manual-v2.1.md"
      - "Customer-Return-Policy-2023.md"
#
    <Tip>
      Format your documents in markdown (.md) for optimal readability by large language models. This ensures better <Tooltip tip="The process of extracting relevant information from the knowledge base">information retrieval</Tooltip> and processing.
    </Tip>
    #
  </Step>

  <Step title="Adding Data to the Knowledge Base">
    Our platform offers multiple methods to populate your knowledge base:

    1. **Direct Text Entry:**
       - Navigate to the "Knowledge" section of your agent
       - Click on "Add New Document"
       - Write or paste your content directly into the text editor

    2. **File Upload:**
       - In the "Knowledge" section, select "Upload File"
       - Choose your document(s) from your local system
       - Supported formats: .txt, .pdf, .docx, .doc, .csv, .xlsx

    3. **Web Scraping:**
       - Use our built-in <Tooltip tip="A tool that automatically extracts data from websites">scraper</Tooltip> to add data from websites
       - Go to "Add Data" > "Web Scraper"
       - Enter the URL or sitemap you want to scrape
       - Select the specific pages or sections to include

    <Note>
      When using the web scraper, ensure you have the necessary permissions to use the content from the target website.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Adding Descriptions and Tags">
    Enhance your knowledge base's searchability by adding context to each document:

    - **Descriptions:** Write a brief (2-3 sentences) summary of the document's content. For example:
      "This document outlines our company's customer return policy, including eligibility criteria, timeframes, and refund processes."

    - **Tags:** Add relevant keywords that describe the document's main topics. For instance:
      #customer-service, #returns, #refunds, #policy

    <Info>
      These descriptions and tags help our <Tooltip tip="AI systems that use machine learning algorithms to process and analyze text">Natural Language Processing (NLP) models</Tooltip> understand the context and relevance of each document, improving the accuracy of information retrieval.
    </Info>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Structuring the Knowledge Base">
    Proper document structure improves readability for both humans and AI. Use a clear hierarchy with headings, subheadings, and bullet points.

    Example structure:

    ```markdown
    # Product X User Manual

    ## 1. Introduction
    - Overview of Product X
    - Key features and benefits

    ## 2. Getting Started
    - Unboxing and setup
    - Initial configuration

    ## 3. Basic Operations
    - Powering on/off
    - Navigating the user interface

    ## 4. Advanced Features
    - Custom settings
    - Integration with other devices

    ## 5. Troubleshooting
    - Common issues and solutions
    - Contacting support
    ```

    <Tip>
      Consistent structure across documents helps the AI agent quickly locate and extract relevant information, leading to more accurate and context-aware responses.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Implementing Advanced Retrieval Techniques">
    To further enhance your AI agent's ability to find and use relevant information, implement our advanced <Tooltip tip="A technique that generates search keywords based on the conversation context">Prompt Similarity Step</Tooltip>:

    1. Navigate to your agent's settings
    2. Go to "Advanced Configuration" > "Retrieval Settings"
    3. Enable "Prompt Similarity Step"
    4. Customize the prompt if needed (we provide a default optimized prompt)

    Here's an example of how the prompt works:

    ```markdown
    You are an advanced AI tasked with generating relevant search keywords. Use the chat history to create accurate and relevant keywords for searching our knowledge base.

    Variables:
    chat_history: {chat_history}

    Steps:
    1. Analyze the chat history and context
    2. Identify main themes, topics, and keywords
    3. Generate a list of specific, relevant keywords for the search

    Output your list of keywords, separated by commas.
    ```

    <Info>
      This advanced technique helps bridge the gap between user queries and your knowledge base content, resulting in more precise and contextually relevant responses from your AI agent.
    </Info>
  </Step>
</Steps>

By following these steps, you'll create a well-structured, easily searchable knowledge base that significantly enhances your AI agent's capabilities. Remember, the quality and organization of your knowledge base directly impact your agent's performance, so invest time in curating and structuring your information effectively.
