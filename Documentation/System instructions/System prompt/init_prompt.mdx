## Overview 

  

The initial prompt overrides the initial message and is used to instruct the AI agent on what to write as the first message. This feature allows for a wide range of creative use cases and variations. You can have the agent write a standardized message or give it the freedom to write something unique each time. 

  

Glowstudio supports Markdown formatting across the platform, enabling the agent to generate headings, use emojis, and even create tables. Additionally, if you enable the UI engine, the agent can create buttons, carousels, and cards. This can be particularly useful for generating conversation starter questions, lead capture , or just fun ways to engage with users. 

  

<Note>Max characters for the initial prompt is 10,000.</Note>

Then generate some random buttons and a card with one button without image with a funny joke in it.

As a final message tell the user to head to the prompt tab on Voiceglow to change the prompts which is the platform that is powering you!
