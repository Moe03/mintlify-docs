### Key Concepts 

  

<Accordion title="Chain of Thought (CoT) Reasoning"> 

Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning is a technique that involves breaking down complex problems into a series of intermediate steps. This approach helps the AI model to: 

  

1. Understand the problem more thoroughly 

2. Show its reasoning process 

3. Arrive at more accurate conclusions 

  

**Example:** 

``` 

Human: What's the result of 25 * 18? 

AI: Let's approach this step-by-step: 

  

1. First, let's break down 25 * 18 into (20 + 5) * 18 

2. Now we can calculate: 

   a) 20 * 18 = 360 

   b) 5 * 18 = 90 

3. Adding these results: 

   360 + 90 = 450 

  

Therefore, 25 * 18 = 450 

``` 

</Accordion> 

  

<Accordion title="Few-Shot Learning"> 

Few-shot learning is a technique where you provide the AI with a small number of examples to guide its understanding of the task. This can be particularly useful when you want the AI to follow a specific format or style in its responses. 

  

- One-shot learning: Providing one example 

- Two-shot learning: Providing two examples 

- Few-shot learning: Providing a few (typically 3-5) examples 

  

**Example:** 

``` 

Human: Translate the following English phrases to French. Here are two examples: 

  

English: Hello, how are you? 

French: Bonjour, comment allez-vous ? 

  

English: Where is the nearest restaurant? 

French: Où est le restaurant le plus proche ? 

  

Now, translate this: 

English: I would like to book a hotel room. 

  

AI: Based on the examples provided, here's the translation: 

  

English: I would like to book a hotel room. 

French: Je voudrais réserver une chambre d'hôtel. 

``` 

</Accordion> 

  

### Formatting Your Prompt 

 # 

<Tip> 

Proper formatting can significantly improve the readability and effectiveness of your prompts. Consider using Markdown or XML tags to structure your prompts. (GPT models read markdown and Anthropic models read XML)

</Tip> 

  #

Here are some formatting techniques: 

  

- Use bold text for emphasis: `**important information**` 

- Use headings to organize sections: `### Section Title` 

- Use lists for step-by-step instructions: 

  ``` 

  1. First step 

  2. Second step 

  3. Third step 

  ``` 

- Use code blocks for examples: 

  ``` 

  ```python 

  def example_function(): 

      return "This is an example" ```
 

  ```

# Step-by-Step Guide to Crafting Effective Prompts 

#

## Step 1: Define the Tone and Objective 

  #

Clearly articulate the AI's role, personality, and primary goals. This sets the foundation for all interactions. 



Glowstudio agents are masters of personality, capable of adopting a wide range of tones and styles to suit your needs. Whether you want a casual chatbot or a professional assistant.
#
<Tip>
**Experiment** with different personas to find the perfect fit for your audience or client. Try these options:
- Set the tone to `slang` for a laid-back and fun personality that will resonate with many customers.
- Request a `nerdy` and tech-savvy personality for tech  blogs or e-commerce.
- Go for a `poetic` style for a book store or blog.
</Tip>
#

Here are some tone setters you can try. Copy and paste them into the system instructions of your agent:  

<CodeGroup> 

  

```markdown Friendly Tone 

You are a friendly and patient tutor specializing in high school mathematics. Your goal is to help students understand complex concepts by breaking them down into simpler terms and providing relatable examples. 

``` 

  

```markdown Professional Tone 

You are a professional financial advisor with expertise in retirement planning. Your objective is to provide clear, concise, and accurate information to clients about various retirement savings options and strategies. 

``` 

  

```markdown Casual Tone 

You're a laid-back virtual travel buddy with a knack for finding hidden gems in popular tourist destinations. Your mission is to help travelers discover unique experiences that are off the beaten path. 

``` 

  

</CodeGroup> 

  #
## Step 2: AI + Context = Truth
#
AI thrives on context. Without it, the model would have no understanding of your situation, problem, or desired outcome. In GlowStudio, context comes from three primary sources: system prompt, user input and the built-in [knowledgebase](https://www.knowledgebase.com).
#

#### Why Context Matters

1. **Improved Accuracy**: Context helps the AI understand the nuances of your query.
2. **Relevance**: With proper context, the AI tailors its answers to your specific situation.
3. **Efficiency**: Clear context and a robust knowledge base reduce the need for follow-up questions.
4. **Personalization**: The more context available, the more personalized the AI's responses become.
#
#### Providing Effective Context

- **Be Specific**: Clearly define the problem, audience, and desired outcome to keep responses relevant and contextually driven.
- **Leverage the Knowledge Base**: GlowStudio's knowledge base provides a layer of information on top of the models training data, ensuring consistent and accurate responses without requiring repetitive input from users. 
- **Set Boundaries**: Inform the AI about any limitations or constraints. This ensures the model always keeps to its task and context.
- **Define Roles**: Specify the role or persona the AI should adopt for more contextual interactions.
#
<Warning>
while more context is generally better, avoid unnecessary details. Focus on details that directly impact the model’s task.
</Warning>
#
**Example using contextually driven prompt engineering:**

<Accordion title="E-commerce wine store">
```markdown

## Step 3: Implement Chain of Thought Reasoning 
#
  

Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning is a powerful technique that guides AI models to break down complex tasks into logical, step-by-step processes. This approach significantly improves the accuracy, reliability, and explainability of AI responses. Here's how to effectively implement CoT reasoning in your prompts:

### Understanding Chain of Thought

CoT reasoning mimics human problem-solving by encouraging the AI to:

1.  Analyze the problem
2.  Break it down into smaller, manageable parts
3.  Solve each part sequentially
4.  Combine the results to reach a final conclusion

### Benefits of CoT Reasoning

-   **Improved Accuracy**: By following a logical sequence, the AI is less likely to make errors or jump to incorrect conclusions.
-   **Enhanced Explainability**: The step-by-step process makes it easier for users to understand how the AI arrived at its answer.
-   **Better Handling of Complex Tasks**: CoT allows the AI to tackle more complicated problems that might be challenging to solve in a single step.
-   **Reduced Hallucinations**: By grounding each step in logic, the AI is less likely to generate false or irrelevant information.

### Implementing CoT in Prompts

1.  **Explicit Instructions**: Tell the AI to think through the problem step-by-step. For example: "Before providing your final answer, please break down the problem and solve it step-by-step."
2.  **Question Decomposition**: Guide the AI to break down complex queries into smaller, more manageable questions. For instance: "To solve this, let's approach it in stages. First, what are the key components of the problem? Second, how do these components relate to each other? Third, ..."
3.  **Intermediate Steps**: Encourage the AI to show its work by providing intermediate results. For example: "As you solve this problem, please share your thought process at each stage, including any intermediate calculations or reasoning."
4.  **Logical Connectors**: Use words like "therefore," "because," "as a result," to encourage logical connections between steps.
5.  **Verification Prompts**: Ask the AI to verify its own work. For instance: "After you've reached a conclusion, please review your steps and ensure they logically lead to your final answer."
  
#

``` 
</CodeGroup> 
</Accordion>
  

## Step 4: Define Restrictions and Boundaries 
#
 
When deploying an AI agent for your clients, it's essential to define clear restrictions and boundaries. This helps redcue hallucinations (like recommending the wrong product) and ensure safe, accurate, and appropriate interactions. This not only enhances the reliability of the Agent but also helps boosting client satisfaction and promotes positive word of mouth for your agency. 

<Tip>Together with prompting, **Temperature** sets the level of randomness in the AI's responses. For more details on how to adjust temperature settings and its effects, [read more here](#temperature-settings).</Tip>

#

### Guidelines for Setting Restrictions, Boundaries, and Specific Instructions
#
-   **Scope of Responses**: Clearly specifying the topics and areas the AI should address ensures that it remains focused on relevant subjects. This prevents the model from providing irrelevant or inappropriate information.
    
-   **Information Sources**: Restricting the AI to use only verified and approved information from the knowledge base ensures consistency and reliability in the responses.
    
-   **User Interactions**: By defining the types of user queries the AI can handle and providing fallback responses for out-of-scope questions, you ensure that users are always guided appropriately. This reduces user frustration and directs them to the correct channels for further assistance.
    
-   **Functional Limitations**: Outlining the actions the AI cannot perform, such as processing payments, tracking orders, or generating images, sets clear expectations. This prevents user disappointment and potential security issues, safeguarding the client's operations.
    
-   **Actions**: Glowstudio offers several possibilites for the AI to use actions. Define how the model should use the [UI Engine](#UI-Engine) and [Tools](Tools) in the system prompt (You can read more about implementing these in their respective docs). 
    

#


  

<Warning> 

Defining clear restrictions is crucial for preventing the AI from engaging in potentially harmful or inappropriate behavior.

## Step 5: Provide Examples (Few-Shot Learning) 

  


Few-shot learning is a powerful technique in prompt engineering that involves providing the AI model with examples of desired interactions. This method helps guide the model to understand and replicate the expected behavior in similar situations.

### Key Benefits:

1.  Improved Output Quality: Examples demonstrate the exact format and content you expect, leading to more accurate and relevant responses.
2.  Consistency: By showing multiple examples, you establish patterns that the AI can follow consistently.
3.  Task Comprehension: Complex or nuanced tasks become clearer when illustrated through examples.
4.  Safety and Control: Examples can demonstrate how to handle sensitive topics or avoid unwanted content.
 # 

<CodeGroup> 

  

```markdown One-shot 

## When answering queries, use the format from the example interaction below:

Human: I received a damaged product. What should I do?
AI: I'm sorry to hear that your product arrived damaged. Here's what you can do:
1. Take clear photos of the damaged item and its packaging.
2. Locate your order number from your confirmation email.
3. Contact our customer service team at support@example.com or call 1-800-123-4567.
4. Provide your order number and a brief description of the damage.
5. Our team will guide you through the return and replacement process.

```  

</CodeGroup> 

 # 

## Step 6: Reinforce Key Instructions 

  

Repeat important instructions throughout the prompt to ensure the AI maintains consistent behavior. 

 # 

<Tip> 

Reinforcing key instructions helps prevent the AI from "forgetting" important guidelines as the conversation progresses. This phenomenon is related to the **"caught in the middle"** effect, where crucial details can be lost or overlooked amidst ongoing interactions.

</Tip> 

  

**Example:** 

<CodeGroup>
```markdown Put this at the bottom of the prompt

Remember: 

- Always maintain a professional and courteous tone. 

- Provide accurate information based on the company's official policies and products. 

- If unsure about any information, recommend that the customer contact customer support for the most up-to-date details. 

- Prioritize customer satisfaction while adhering to company guidelines. 

``` 

```markdown Example with reinforcement

You are an AI assistant for an e-commerce store. Your task is to assist customers with product inquiries and make recommendations based on their needs. Use the following product catalog to inform your responses:

<product_catalog>
{{PRODUCT_CATALOG}}
</product_catalog>

When interacting with customers, follow these guidelines:

Greet the customer politely and professionally.
Carefully read and understand the customer's query.
Provide accurate information about products from the catalog.
If a specific product is mentioned, give details about its features, price, and availability.
If the customer is looking for recommendations:
a. Consider their stated preferences and needs.
b. Suggest 2-3 relevant products from the catalog.
c. Briefly explain why each recommendation suits their requirements.
If a product is out of stock or unavailable, offer similar alternatives.
Be concise but informative in your responses.
Use a friendly and helpful tone throughout the interaction.
If the customer's query is unclear, politely ask for clarification.
Do not make up information about products not listed in the catalog.
Format your response as follows:

Begin with a greeting.
Address the customer's query or provide recommendations.
End with a polite closing and an offer for further assistance.
Here is the customer's query:

<customer_query>
{{CUSTOMER_QUERY}}
</customer_query>

Provide your response to the customer query, following the guidelines above. Begin your response with <response> and end it with </response>.

Remember to always:

Greet the customer politely and professionally.
Carefully read and understand the customer's query.
Provide accurate information from the product catalog.
Offer relevant recommendations based on the customer's needs.
Maintain a friendly and helpful tone throughout the interaction.
Be concise but informative.

```

## Step 7 (optional):  Advanced Prompting Techniques to Improve AI Responses 

 # 

Research has shown that certain advanced prompting techniques can significantly enhance the relevance and accuracy of AI responses. Two notable techniques include: 
#
  

1. **Taking a deep breath**: 

   Encouraging the AI to think methodically by using phrases like: 

   - "Take a deep breath and think about what you are going to respond before writing it." 

   - "Take a deep breath and work on this problem step-by-step." 

  

   >Helps the AI to slow down and process the information more thoroughly, leading to more accurate and relevant responses. For more details, you can read the study [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03409). 
#
  

2. **Highlighting Importance of situation**: 

   Highlighting the critical nature of the task with phrases such as: 

 

   - "This is a life or death situation. Its critical that your response is correct." 

 

   - "This is critical to the survival of my business" 

  

   This technique can make the AI prioritize accuracy and importance, resulting in more focused and precise outputs. 

  

### Example Prompt Using Both Techniques 

  

Here's an example of a prompt that incorporates both advanced techniques:
