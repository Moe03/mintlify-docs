title: 'Initial Message'
---


## Overview 

  

The initial message in Glowstudio allows you to set predefined starter messages that your AI agent sends every time a new user interacts with the widget. These messages help set the tone and provide initial guidance to users. 

  

You can add multiple variants of the initial message, and a random variant will be shown to the user each time for a unique experience. You also have the option to generate new variants using AI, which can save time and effort. 

>Initial prompts override the initial message. Read about this [here](/Documentation/System%instructions/initial%message/init_prompt.mdx)

<Tip>Make sure to review all AI-generated messages to fact-check and avoid any hallucinations or incorrect information.</Tip>
