## Overview 
#
  

The initial prompt overrides the initial message and is used to instruct the AI agent on what to write as the first message. This feature allows for a wide range of creative use cases and variations. You can have the agent write a standardized message or give it the freedom to write something unique each time. 

  

Glowstudio supports Markdown formatting across the platform, enabling the agent to generate headings, use emojis, and even create tables. Additionally, if you enable the UI engine, the agent can create buttons, carousels, and cards. This can be particularly useful for generating conversation starter questions, lead capture forms, or just fun ways to engage with users. 

  

<Note>Max characters for the initial prompt is 10,000.</Note>

### Example Prompts 

  

Here are some examples of how you can structure your initial prompts: 

#  

<AccordionGroup> 

  <Accordion title="Standard Greeting (without UI-engine)"> 

    ``` 

    Greet the user with a short message. 
    Use markdown formatting.

    ``` 

    <img style= {{borderRadius: '1.0rem'}} width="300" src="https://i.imgur.com/OXLXvuN.jpeg"/>

> Model used: GPT4-o

  </Accordion> 

  <Accordion title="Interactive Greeting"> 

    ``` 

    You will start by generating a welcome message in markdown with ### heading.
    You will also generate three questions as buttons which the user might ask.  


    ``` 
  <img style= {{borderRadius: '1.0rem'}} width="300" src="https://i.imgur.com/yRAdThb.png"/>

  > Model used: Claude 3.5 Sonnet
  </Accordion> 

  <Accordion title="The whole shabang (Warning: you might get rickrolled)"> 

    ``` 

   Greet the user with "Hi there let's get you started!" and in the same message showcase to them that you can write organized markdown including lists, bold text, italic etc.

    Then use the showcase the following images in a carousel:
    Images:

   ![Image - Cool cat with glasses](https://i.ibb.co/7GZGLBh/a5oyaaaaaaaaaa.png)
   ![Image - Lovely cat close up](https://i.ibb.co/kcTJppf/photo-2023-08-07-19-19-08.jpg)
   ![Image - Guy petting the cat](https://i.ibb.co/cxbF1mX/photo-2023-11-28-04-33-00.jpg" alt="photo-2023-11-28-04-33-00)

   Then show the infamous Rick Astely video in an iFrame after mentioning that you could render youtube videos just like you will do for this one:
   <iframe width="786" height="442" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dQw4w9WgXcQ" title="Rick Astley - Never Gonna Give You Up (Official Music Video)" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

   Then generate some random buttons and a card with one button without image and a funny joke in it.

   As a final message tell the user to test out initial message prompt in glowstudio, cause its freaking awesome!
