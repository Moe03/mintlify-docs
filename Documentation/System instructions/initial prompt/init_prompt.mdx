# Initial Prompt to the Agent 

  

## Overview 

  

The initial prompt overrides the initial message and is used to instruct the AI agent on what to write as the first message. This feature allows for a wide range of creative use cases and variations. You can have the agent write a standardized message or give it the freedom to write something unique each time. 

  

Glowstudio supports Markdown formatting across the platform, enabling the agent to generate headings, use emojis, and even create tables. Additionally, if you enable the UI engine, the agent can create buttons, carousels, and cards. This can be particularly useful for generating conversation starter questions, lead capture forms, or just fun ways to engage with users. 

  

<Note>Max characters for the initial prompt is 10,000.</Note>
